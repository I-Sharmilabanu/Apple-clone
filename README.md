# Apple-clone


This is an Apple Clone Website built using React and Tailwind CSS.
In this project, every section is created as a separate component, then combined into one page — making the code clean, organized, and easy to debug.

💡 About the Project

This Apple Clone is my first step in building a structured React project using component-based development.
I recreated the Apple-style sections like product cards, hero sections, and simple layouts to understand how big websites structure their UI.
Tailwind CSS made styling fast, smooth, and more comfortable, just like my previous projects.

Building each section separately helped me learn how easy debugging becomes when components are isolated.
